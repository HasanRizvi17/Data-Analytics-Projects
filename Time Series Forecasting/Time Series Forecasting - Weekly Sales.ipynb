        "1. Differencing Check: pmdarima.auto_arima internally checks whether differencing is necessary to make the time series stationary. It looks at the original series and conducts statistical tests (like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test) to assess stationarity. If the series is already stationary (or if it's seasonal), it may not apply any differencing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Order Selection: The function searches through various combinations of orders (p, d, q) and seasonal orders (P, D, Q, s) to determine the best ARIMA or SARIMA model based on criteria such as AIC or BIC. It considers differencing orders (d and D) as part of the order selection process.\n",

It creates a grid of all possible combinations and systematically tests each one.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Exhaustive Search: Grid search is exhaustive, meaning it doesn't skip any combination. It tests all possibilities, making it a comprehensive approach.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Stepwise Search: The search algorithm begins by fitting ARIMA models for all combinations of the candidate orders (p, d, q) and evaluates their performance using a chosen criterion, such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion). It typically considers a few candidate models (not all possible combinations) to speed up the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Refinement: Based on the initial fits, the algorithm selects the best-fitting model (lowest AIC) among the candidates.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Iterative Process: The algorithm iteratively refines the selected model by considering nearby values of p, d, and q. It may explore variations of the current best-fitting model by incrementing or decrementing each order component (e.g., try p+1, p-1, d+1, d-1, q+1, q-1).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Stopping Criteria: The stepwise search continues until a predefined stopping criterion is met. The criterion might include a maximum number of iterations or convergence to a model that doesn't significantly improve the chosen criterion (e.g., AIC).\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the stepwise search method is more efficient than trying all possible combinations of p, d, and q because it narrows down the search space to a set of candidate models and iteratively refines the selected model based on performance. This approach helps to find a reasonably good-fitting ARIMA model while avoiding an exhaustive search through all possible combinations, which can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.\n",

        "- Search Strategy: In a grid search, you specify a range of possible values for each hyperparameter, and the search method evaluates every possible combination of hyperparameters within those specified ranges. It creates a grid of all possible combinations and systematically tests each one.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Exhaustive Search: Grid search is exhaustive, meaning it doesn't skip any combination. It tests all possibilities, making it a comprehensive approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Complexity: Grid search can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters or a wide range of values for each hyperparameter. The search space grows exponentially with the number of hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Advantages: Grid search is guaranteed to find the best combination of hyperparameters within the specified ranges, given enough computational resources and time. It is a simple and straightforward approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Disadvantages: It can be slow and computationally intensive, especially when dealing with a large search space. It may not be feasible in situations with limited computational resources.\n",

        "**Step-Wise Search:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Search Strategy: A step-wise search, also known as a sequential search, starts with an initial set of hyperparameters and iteratively adjusts them. It often uses a heuristic approach to select the next set of hyperparameters, based on the results of the previous evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Iterative Process: The step-wise method adjusts one hyperparameter at a time while keeping the others fixed. The goal is to reach an optimal or near-optimal set of hyperparameters through a series of steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Complexity: Step-wise methods are typically less computationally intensive than grid search because they explore a smaller portion of the hyperparameter space at each step. This can make them more suitable for cases with limited computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Advantages: Step-wise methods can be faster and more efficient than grid search, as they focus on promising regions of the hyperparameter space based on intermediate results. They may also be more suitable for real-time or online learning settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Disadvantages: Step-wise methods might not guarantee finding the global optimum, and they are sensitive to the initial choice of hyperparameters. The final result can be influenced by the order in which hyperparameters are adjusted."
