# What is RFM Analysis? (Brief Overview)

RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to analyze and categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior. The acronym "RFM" stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. These three dimensions are used to segment customers into different groups, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing strategies more effectively.
- **Recency (R)**: Recency refers to how recently a customer has made a purchase. Customers who have made a purchase more recently are considered more valuable as they are likely to be more engaged and active.
- **Frequency (F)**: Frequency refers to how often a customer makes purchases. Customers who make frequent purchases are also considered more valuable, as they demonstrate loyalty and ongoing engagement with the brand.
- **Monetary Value (M)**: Monetary value refers to the total amount of money a customer has spent on purchases. Customers who have spent more money are typically considered more valuable, as they contribute more directly to the company's revenue.

RFM analysis involves assigning each customer a score for each of these three dimensions, typically on a scale from 1 to 5 or 1 to 10. These scores are then combined to create RFM segments, which can be used to identify different groups of customers:
- **High RFM**: Customers with high scores in all three dimensions are considered the most valuable and are often the primary target for marketing efforts.
- **Mid RFM**: Customers with moderate scores in one or more dimensions may require different marketing strategies to encourage further engagement.
- **Low RFM**: Customers with low scores in all three dimensions may require special attention or re-engagement efforts to prevent them from becoming inactive or lost.

RFM analysis can help businesses better understand their customer base, identify opportunities for upselling and cross-selling, personalize marketing campaigns, and improve overall customer retention and satisfaction

# Post RFM Analysis Strategies to Target Customers
### RFM Strategies:
- **Champions**: contact them even before adding another product to our portfolio and have their opinion on it since they might have a good idea as they are in direct contact with customers. Focus on loyalty programs and new product introductions. These customers have proven to have a higher willingness to pay, so don't use discount pricing to generate incremental sales. Instead, focus on value added offers through product recommendations based on previous purchases. Get suggestions and feedback about our services.
- **Loyal Customers**: contact them even before adding another product to our portfolio and have their opinion on it since they might have a good idea as they are in direct contact with customers. Loyalty programs are effective for these repeat visitors. Get feedback about our services.
- **Potential Loyalists**: Can run a loyalty program for them. We want to make sure their initial experience with your product and service is pleasant and memorable (as we have seen that many of the customers in our data have not placed any order after their first one and that is an indicator that their first experience was not good). Follow up with a few timely promotions during their initial stages and they are highly likely to buy again. Sending informational content about our products to these customers will also increase their engagement with your brand.
- **New customers**: Most customers never graduate to loyal. Having clear strategies in place for first time buyers such as triggered welcome messages and introducing to them more of our products can potentially pay dividends.
- **Needing Attention**: Make limited time offers. Recommend based on past purchases. Offer free limited trials for new products/skus added to our portfolio. Make limited time offers/deals for them.
- **Can’t Lose**: Need to pay special attention to them. Send personalized messages, call to reconnect with these customers or send salespersons to their shops. We may even offer repeat purchases at a discount (or slightly aggressive price incentives) or run surveys to address their concerns before you lose them to competitors/alternatives. Can also give a courtesy call to them asking about their experience (and what went wrong) and give them special treatment (like giving them order fulfilment preferences in case of low stock and orders from multiple customers) to re-engage them.
- **At Risk**: Need to pay special attention to them. Send personalized messages, call to reconnect with these customers, or send salespersons to their shops. We may even offer repeat purchases at a discount (or slightly aggressive price incentives) or run surveys to address their concerns before you lose them to competitors/alternatives.
- **Lost**: Revive interest with reach out campaign. Ignore otherwise.
- **Customers with an RFM score of 414**: We should treat them VERY carefully and make sure that their initial experiences go perfectly fine as they are recent customers who have loads of potential and can generate a lot of revenue (they have generated very high GMV in very few orders, with a huge AOV and have ordered from us very recently).
- **Customers with an RFM score of X14 (114, 214, 314)**: These customers have demonstrated a high willingness to pay. Consider premium offers or value add cross/up-sells to increase AOV. Don't waste margin on discounts. 

### Potential for Loyalty Program
•	Tiered incentives can ignite customer engagement and prompt them to purchase more. You can begin with basic membership rewards to encourage customers to sign up for the loyalty program and offer more valuable rewards to your repeat clients as they increase their purchasing volumes. (Dastgyr app can have a point tracker). By gaining more points, buyers can level up from one tier to the next. Leveling up to the next tier can offer more benefits, better pricing, or other incentives.
•	Referral programs can be used to offer more bonuses to customers/retailers as they invite more customers. Newly referred customers are eligible for this bonus as well. This will make participating in the program a win-win for everyone.
